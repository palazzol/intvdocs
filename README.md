# intvdocs

These documents were originally created on MS-DOS, using text and graphics characters.
They have been converted from cp437 encoding to UTF-8 encoding, to be rendered properly on modern computers

This was accomplished with the help of this website:

For best results, you can view them in a modern text editor like Visual Studio Code, or just view them in raw mode on github.
